The code provides an implementation of the Aberth method for finding the roots of a polynomial. The main function is `aberth_solve`, which takes the coefficients of the polynomial as input and returns a list of unique roots as output. 

The Aberth method is an iterative method that uses initial approximations obtained through random perturbations to find all roots of a polynomial simultaneously. The method is run for multiple trials with different initial estimates to ensure robustness against converging to the same root multiple times. 

The code also includes helper functions such as `_round_val` to round numbers to a specified number of decimal places and `_aberth_method_trial` to perform the Aberth iteration for a given trial. 

The code includes a test case class `PolynomialRootsTest` that verifies the correctness of the implementation using various test cases. The test cases cover linear polynomials, quadratic polynomials with real and complex roots, polynomials with all zero coefficients, and randomly generated polynomials with varying degrees. 

To run the script, simply execute the code at the bottom of the file (`unittest.main()`) or run the file as a module.
