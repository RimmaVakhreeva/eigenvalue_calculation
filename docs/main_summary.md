This code file contains two tasks: task_1 and task_2.

In task_1, a matrix is defined and its eigenvalues are calculated using the eigvals() function from the eigenval module. The matrix and the calculated eigenvalues are then printed.

In task_2, a function f(x) = e^x + x^3 - 2 is defined. The integral value of this function from -1 to 1 is calculated using the trapezoid() function from the integrate module. The calculated integral value is then printed.

To run this code, simply execute the script and the tasks will be performed automatically.
