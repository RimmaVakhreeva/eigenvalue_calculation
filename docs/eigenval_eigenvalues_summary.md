This code file contains a function called "eigvals" that calculates the eigenvalues of a given matrix using its characteristic polynomial. 

The function takes a matrix as input and returns a vector containing the eigenvalues. It first computes the characteristic polynomial of the matrix using the "characteristic_polynomial" function from the "poly" module. Then, it uses the "aberth_solve" function from the "roots" module to find the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which are the eigenvalues of the matrix.

The code also includes a unit test class called "TestEigvals" that tests the "eigvals" function. It uses the "numpy" library to generate random matrices of different sizes and compares the eigenvalues calculated by the "eigvals" function with the eigenvalues calculated by the "numpy.linalg.eigvals" function. It asserts that the number of eigenvalues is the same and checks if each eigenvalue is approximately equal within a certain number of decimal places.

To run the script, you can simply execute it as a standalone Python script, and it will run the unit test.
